How to map many to many relationship using joins?
 - use multiple join query

Natural Join
- remove redundant columns/data when joining tables

Self Join
- used for heirarchical data inside a single table
 ex:
 * category_id & subcategory_id
 * employee_id & supervisor_id

Cross Join
- used for one to many relationships. every row "FROM" a table is multiplied to the number of rows with
another table.
 ex:
 * meals table + drinks table
 *  t-shirts table + color table
